Execute the recipe usergrp.rb for the above to be done.

# Download the tar file from the Apache.org website

Source code is often packed for download as a TAR (Tape ARchive) file, that is a standard format in the Unix/Linux world. These files have a .tar extension; they can also be compressed, the extension is .tar.gz. 

In this cookbook, the installation of tomcat takes places by untaring the tomcat tar file.

# Permissions 

The group named tomcat and the tomcat user need to be given permissions on the extracted files.
This permissions were given to both group and user by running the permissions.rb recipe.
